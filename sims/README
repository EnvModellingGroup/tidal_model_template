For model runs create a directory for each simulation set-up. You often set these up *after* running the base case. However, you don't want to copy all the output too.

The easiest way of copying the base-case once it's been used to run a model is:
mkdir new_sim
cp base_case/*.py new_sim/
cp base_case/*.pbs new_sim/

This will copy the python and viking scripts in the new directory, but not the __pycache__ and output folders

Try and avoid putting any common data file in directories in here - put then in data. Likewise, but meshes in the mesh directory. You can point to them via the python scripts.

The params.py file lives above the individual simulation directories. This contains all the common parameters. You can override them in any individual simulation as you see fit.
